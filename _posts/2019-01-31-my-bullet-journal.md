Since the first months of 2018, I started using an agenda to organize all my pending events and tasks. As a result, I became more "productive" and "tidy" with my methodology to have things done, I even started to use Calendar by Google for scheduling the events that come up on the week. These habits make me feel like a grown-up man, but a one well organized.

In fact, it was not until the end of 2018  that I discovered the world of Bullet Journal. When I diced to get into this community, I got overwhelmed with all the work and suggestions that were there. For example, I want to add a lot of unnecessary trackers, unnecessary for me, and really arty designs for my own. Even my girl make fun of me for use the year in pixels. So I wrote it down in my year in pixels tracker... That was a blue day.

Anyway, I need to define what necessities my bullet journal has to cover. So I made a list:

- Cover
- Personal Information & Time Schedule
- Semester Calendar
- Key
- Future Log
- Agenda 2019
- Sketch section
- Trackers
    - Year in Pixels
    - Habit Tracker

## Cover
This is my journal first page, and it is simple. Just my logo on the middle of the page, and the current year at the corner.

## Personal Information, Time Schedule & Calendar of the Semester
I'm happy about the arrangement of these sections of the journal. Because the Time Schedule and the Calendar are linked with the current college semester. So, in order to remove and add pages, they need to share the same sheet of paper.

## Key
I based my key on the one that is on the [website][1], modifying the way to represent events and canceled tasks. The coolest part of the bullet journal is that you can customize the main idea based on what your needs are.

## Future Log
This is a good way to plan and organize future tasks and goals across the year.

## Agenda
I really like to work with a weekly planner. Being able to add tasks and events, and see them on continues pages.
The fun part here is that I design a template with Inkscape, and generate the entire agenda with a python script that I coded.

## Sketch section
These are just a bunch of blank sheets. With the idea of being able to add more pages, the whole journal is attached with two rings.

## Trackers
Maybe this is cheating, but I do not feel comfortable to carry around personal goals and logs, and that the people can be able to see them. So instead of adding them to my journal, I made a spreadsheet with Google Docs. This way I can easily modify my trackers and be able to edit them in any device.

### Year in Pixels
This is a cool one, my implementation it's basically the association of colors with feelings, and paint a grid (that represents the whole year) with them. Additionally, I added a log where I describe why I felt that way.
I'm doing this for the statistic potential...

### Habit Tracker
This is really self-explanatory. I just fill the cell if I did it, or leave it blank if I didn't do it.
The interesting part here, is that I have a tracker for daily, weekly and monthly habits. So, designing a simple way to be able to visualize all that tracking info was fun.

This is my journal for this 2019, I hope it was helpful and inspiring for you. Happy new year.
