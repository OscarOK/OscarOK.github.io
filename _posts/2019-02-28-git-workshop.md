This will be a series of posts with the material that I prepared for a git introduction workshop, given to some students of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua.

![The Workshop][workshop]

The first thing will be to define what this material is not, it is not intended that before reading and working with some of the topics that I prepared you to become a Git expert. Actually, this is an introduction for people that have just heard about this tool and have the interest to learn it. Also, this is a workshop, even that is divided into units a lot of the material does not follow a structure that you will find in a book.
I believe that the right way to see it, is more like personal notes from a person who already work with Git for a time and that I can be able to answer some questions about "problems" that appear while we use this tool or doubts in who we can do some specific action.

## Units
These notes are divided into the followed units:
- **Unit I** - _And what is version control?_
- **Unit II** - _First steps_
- **Unit III** - _Parallel lines_
- **Unit IV** - _Tags & Repentances_
- **Unit V** - _Collaboration & GUI_

_Git is not hard to learn, it just too versatile._
