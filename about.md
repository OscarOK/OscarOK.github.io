My name is Oscar, a simple _computologist_.

<!-- I have been programming since 2016 actually I was born into a computer, my mother compiled me in 1997. -->

I come from a northern state of Mexico, the land of _carne asada_ and _the ones with light feet_.

Just to be clear, I will become an engineer in computer science; while that is proceeding. I want to share what I know with the world.
I'm interested in learning any new topic that raises my interest; as well as computer science topics software engineering crafting and building things up.

If you are just as excited to start this adventure, you can check out my [posts](/).
